Compilation and Execution:

1. Compile the java Code:
javac -d out -cp "libs/*" src/main/App.java src/api/ChatGPTClient.java src/utils/FileUtils.java src/utils/TestSubsetGenerator.java src\main\MultiFunctionTester.java

2. Run Program Synthesis:

Baseline method:
java -cp "out;libs/*" main.App baseline

Decomposition method:
java -cp "out;libs/*" main.App decomposition

3. Run Evaluation:
java -cp out main.MultiFunctionTester

4. Visualisation of the results:

python effectiveness_plotter.py             # Creates a line chart showing the verification success rate for both methods
python effectiveness_boxplot.py             # Creates boxplots showing the distribution of verification success rates across all functions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# =====================================================
# Evaluation and Result Saving (Overview)
# =====================================================

- After running synthesis (both baseline and decomposition), the evaluation results are saved in the "results/" folder. This includes all synthesis runs across all proportions of synthesis
examples for all functions.

- The file "test_results.csv" is created automatically to store the evaluation results of the programs generated by the OpenAI-API. It also serves as the input for all visualization scripts.

- The generated plots (line chart, boxplots) are saved as .png files in the root directory.

# Project Structure Notes
# =====================================================

 - src/funktions/: Contains all functions used in the synthesis.

    Each function folder includes:
       - baseline_skeleton.txt      # skeleton for the baseline method
       - skeleton.txt               # skeleton for the decomposition method
       - tests_250.txt              # 250 test cases to evaluat the synthesized function

 - decomposition_tests/:
     Contains Unit-Tests for each hole using the decomposition method.
 - baseline_tests.txt: Contains Unit-Tests for the whole function using the baseline method.
